## Security Features

CloudHound implements the following security measures:

### Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT Authentication:** Using PyJWT library with HS256 algorithm
- **API Key Support:** SHA256-hashed keys with constant-time comparison
- **Token Expiration:** Configurable JWT expiry (default: 1 hour)

### Input Validation

- **Cypher Query Whitelist:** Only read-only queries allowed (MATCH...RETURN, CALL db.*, CALL apoc.*)
- **Pydantic Models:** Request validation for all API endpoints
- **Profile Name Validation:** Alphanumeric with limited special characters
- **AWS Credential Validation:** Format validation for access keys

### Data Protection

- **Credential Handling:** AWS credentials cleared from memory after use
- **CORS Configuration:** Specific origin validation (no wildcards)
- **Zip Bomb Protection:** Size and file count limits for uploads

### Infrastructure Security

- **Neo4j Connection:** Supports authenticated connections
- **Environment Variables:** Sensitive config via environment only
- **No Credential Storage:** Credentials never persisted to disk

## Security Best Practices

When deploying CloudHound:

1. **Use HTTPS:** Always deploy behind TLS-terminating proxy
2. **Restrict CORS:** Configure `CLOUDHOUND_CORS_ORIGINS` appropriately
3. **Secure Neo4j:** Enable authentication, use strong passwords
4. **Network Isolation:** Run API and Neo4j in private network
5. **Least Privilege:** Use read-only Neo4j users where possible
6. **Audit Logging:** Enable logging for security events
7. **Regular Updates:** Keep CloudHound and dependencies updated
